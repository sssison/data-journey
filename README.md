# 📊 Personal Developer Road Map Focused on Data Science and Data Analytics

As a recent graduate, I want to be able to continuously upskill in the field of data. I got inspired by Ken Jee's #66DaysOfData challenge. So, this repository will serve as the documentation of my own version of the challenge.

### <mark style="background-color: #344966"> Day 01: Reviewing Python </mark>

Today, I went back through my EEE 111 syllabus to refamiliarize myself about the basics of programming using python. I also used W3Schools as a reference. To give myself some structure and some test, I followed the Introduction to Python course of Datacamp.

Some of the topics that I refreshed were:
1. Variables: Naming Scheme, Assignment
2. Datatypes: Primitive Datatypes, Typecasting,
3. String Operations: Slicing, Methods, Escape Characters,
4. Boolean
5. Operators: Arithmetic, Bitwise
6. Loops and Conditionals: If-else, Switch-case, For, While, 

I think that's it for now. I might get into some data structures later, particularly lists, array, tuples, and dictionary as a precursor to the actual DSA that I will get into tomorrow or maybe I'll follow it up with OOP first before the aactual DSA.
